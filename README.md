# Pokemon TCG Pocket Luck Calculator

This fan-made calculator uses some simple HTML/CSS/JS to determine how lucky PTCGP players have been with their packs and cards.

Feel free to submit a PR if you'd like to contribute.

Open issues:
 - Users have to exclude cards they received from wonder packs
 - Users have to manually add cards they converted to items back to their count
 - The binomial probability calculations are a bit off since a single pack can yield multiple rare cards
